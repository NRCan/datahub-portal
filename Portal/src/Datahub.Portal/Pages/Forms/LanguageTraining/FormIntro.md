The NRCan Language School is offering part-time as well as limited full-time language training for the spring 2024 session, scheduled from April 8, 2024 to June 14, 2024.

NRCan believes in supporting employees in achieving a working level ability in their second official language. Language training is available to indeterminate and term employees. Although the NRCan Language School is the preferred service provider, contracts with external providers may also be used.

- In-Person Group Training (part-time): four to eight hours a week in groups of six and eight learners at the 588 Booth Street (Ottawa) work location
- Hybrid and Virtual - Part-Time Training: between 4 and 8 hours per week, in groups of 6 to 8 learners
- In-Person and Virtual – Full-Time Training (French program only): 37.5 hours per week, in groups of 6 to 8 learners

Group training will be scheduled on a quarterly basis; whereas coaching is available on an ad hoc basis once an employee has been provided with a SLE testing date.

**NOTES:**
- **The NRCan Language School discretion will be applied to ensure continuity of training for existing learners, mandatory needs and equitability.**
- **Language training is based on demand and capacity of the NRCan Language School. Submitting a request for language training does not guarantee a place in a session.**

Should the NRCan Language School be unable to fulfill your training needs, an external provider may be considered. For external provider options, please <u>[contact your procurement advisor](https://gcdocs.gc.ca/nrcan-rncan/llisapi.dll/link/19125621)</u> for confirmation of the procurement options available to you.
