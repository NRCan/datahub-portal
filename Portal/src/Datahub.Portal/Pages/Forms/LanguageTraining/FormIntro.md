As of April 2023, no direct costing will be associated to language training with NRCan Language School (only). A centralized budget will be allocated to the school to provide language training to as many NRCan employees as possible, based on priority placement, capacity of the NRCan Language School and demand.

NRCan believes in supporting employees in achieving a working level ability in their second official language. Language training is available to indeterminate and term employees. Although the NRCan Language School is the preferred service provider, contracts with external providers may also be used.

Training options offered by the NRCan Language School are as follows:

-  Virtual - Part-Time Training: between 4 and 8 hours per week, in groups of 6 to 8 learners
-  Virtual – Full-Time Training (French program only): 37.5 hours per week, in groups of 6 to 8 learners
-  Individual - Coaching – up to 5 one-hour sessions (in preparation of a scheduled SLE test date) and can be requested via an e-mail to the NRCan Language School inbox at [languagetraining-formationlinguistique@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](mailto:languagetraining-formationlinguistique@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca)

Group training will be scheduled on a quarterly basis; whereas coaching is available on an ad hoc basis once an employee has been provided with a SLE testing date.

**NOTE – Language training is based on demand and capacity of the NRCan Language School. Submitting a request for language training does not guarantee a place in a session.**

Should the NRCan Language School be unable to fulfill your training needs, an external provider may be considered. For external provider options, please <u>[contact your procurement advisor](https://gcdocs.gc.ca/nrcan-rncan/llisapi.dll/link/19125621)</u> for confirmation of the procurement options available to you.
